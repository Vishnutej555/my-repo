this is my practice of git 
first there are two type of version control system 
version control system = software configuration management.
git if very fast 
command of git 
git clone to copy form remote to local 
git status to check the status
git add. used to convert into stagging 
git commit to cobnvert into local
git push to transfer into remote we use push
git pull  to tranfer into local
git log check the staus who did what we use git clone.
